# Prinicpal-Component-Analysis
PCA using SVD and GHA 

### Introduction 
This repo contains code for doing prinicipal component analysis using singular value decomposition (SVD) and genralised hebbian learning (GHA). In SVD we develop sample covariance matrix and do eigen decompositions to calculate the all the prinicpal components. In GHA we use a special neural network which is used to compute the prinical components.
